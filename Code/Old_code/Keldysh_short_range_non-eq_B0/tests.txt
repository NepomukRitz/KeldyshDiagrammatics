Notations: Each Channel has a retarded component (a, except for X-Channel, where it's a.transpconj()) and a Keldysh component (b)

Tests successfully run on the non-equilibrium code:

- Leads both at the same chemical potential and temperature -> Recover equilibrium results and satisfy FDTs.
- If the self energy is zero, then S ~ G.
- The channels satisfy an RPA-like equation if the self-energy does not flow and the interchannel feed-back is turned off.
- The retarded components of the channels and and self-energy satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relation (related to being analytic in the upper half plane).
- The keldysh components are anti-hermitian.
- The imaginary part of the diagonal components of the self energy is smaller than zero for small, finite bias voltage.
- The Ward-identity relating the self energy and the 2-particle vertex is violated only in order U^3.

Comments:
- For large bias (V_sd ~ OmegaX), the violation of the Ward-Id for interesting interaction strengths is severe (current J computed by J ~ \dot n_L and by J ~ \dot n_R differs by ~20%). Consequently, this data cannot be trusted!
- For large bias, the conductance seems to become negative/ the current looks constant. While data is not be trusted, there is an intuitive picture of why the vertex-correction reduces conductance: It opens up phase space for relevant scatterings where previously reflected leftmoving electrons now pick up sufficient energy from the already transported rightmoving electrons to pass the barrier (for mu_L > mu_R).
